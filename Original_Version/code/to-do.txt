1. 'txt' are input from Camera Calibration. If one use real camera, he should do Camera Calibration to attain correct parameters for eye and scene cameras lens.
2. 'testImage' seems un-used.
3. 'Test_Mean_Variance_Data' is for tmp output when running the whole code with Visual Studio C++, the code should be modified to output result in ../result.
4. The original 'Result' folder containing gaze estimation results is moved and renamed as '../result/Gaze_Estimation_Result'. The code should be modified to automatically output gaze estimation results in '../result/Gaze_Estimation_Result'.
5. The 'lib_setting' contains all the .props that are needed to be included when using Visual Studio C++ project(.sln)to run the whole code. The 'Opencv410_Release_x64.props' is needed.
6. See_Variance_Gaussian2D.m is used to generate error-Gaussian image like '../result/out_test_15/centerEstimation_convexHullFineCenter_vfinal.png' taking input '../result/out_test_15/centerEstimation_convexHullFineCenter_vfinal.txt'. It should be integrated into a script that can be automatically run with the main code.
