//You can also see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeBhwbRoKvk


step 1 
download opencv

step 2
download CMake

step 3
download TBB library
https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download

-> Stable Release -> Windows* OS
****The TBB library needs to place in the same folder with opencv************

step4
open CMake

"Where is the source code" -> place source folder in the opencv file you just download.
"Where to build the binaries" -> open a new folder in source named "build" and place in it.

put "Configure"
Select VS 2012 x64(能建成x64就建x64，效能比x86快一倍)

step5

Interface:
UseTBB   NOT

In the red region of CMake
select WITH_TBB

press "Configrue"

TBB_INCLUDE_DIR not found in the first line(red)
select "->tbb42_20140601oss(the TBB library you just downloaded)->include"

"Configure" again

check Interface:
UseTBB   YES


step6
Generate


Step7 
open the OpenCV.sln in "opencv\src\build" 
Build->Build Soluton

Step8
Back to EyeGazeTrackingSystem_vf vs2012 
Property Manager -> Release|x64 -> 右鍵 Add New Property Sheet
C/C++ Additional Include Directories: 設定 Include Directories 到opencv 的 source 中的 include
Linker General -> Additional Library Directories: 設定build 好的 lib 位置(Release版)
Linker Input: Additional Dependencies 放入lib中的所有檔案名稱(.lib)
環境變數添加Path到build好的bin資料夾
